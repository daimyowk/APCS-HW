Ball.java
-should clarify what xa and ya mean and do (lines 8-9)
-should also clarify why needed constructor with Game class (lines 12-14)
-maybe use else if at lines 19 and lines 23. makes it not have to
go through both if first one is true
-seems fine. just needs comments explaining each method

Racquet.java/Paddle.java
-same with Ball.java, clarify xa (line 10) and why constructor
of Game is need (lines 13-15)
-the Game class doesn't seem to be called in any of Paddle's methods
so maybe Constructor isnt really needed
-once again just add comment explaining everything

Overall code seems to be all fine.
